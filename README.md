# Grimoire
An Open-source, work in progress Gran Turismo 5/6 Custom Server.

**Most of the actual work is being done in private until completed. This is just a proof of concept.**

### ⚠️ [Any project using this source code is not endorsed, unwanted, and strongly advised against. It is not remotely ready for production, has no safety precautions, and in the cases of using it on real hardware, can and WILL cause PSN bans by simply reporting names. These includes the GT6 "revivals" that can be found around using this code.](https://github.com/Nenkai/Grimoire/blob/master/REGARDING_OTHER_ONLINE_SERVERS.md)

## State of the project
**Heavily unfinished, can break easily.**
So far the server allows GT5 and GT6 players to login, certain community features are supported but not all. Everything is still very stub and very likely subject to change
